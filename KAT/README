The current development was carried out in Coq 8.4pl1, compiled with OCaml 4.00.1.

This development requires the Containers contribution. 
This is available at the following address: http://coq.inria.fr/pylons/contribs/view/Containers/v8.4

The file teste.v contains some examples of compiler certification as described in the work of Kozen and Paron.

The file hoare.v contains the example of the verification of the partial correctness of the factorial
program, using KAT.

To build the file one can use the following sequence of commands:
coq_makefile -f files.txt -o Makefile ; make
